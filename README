porting my shell from lab19 to freeRTOS based on zzz0072's modification.

Thank and respect zzz0072's effort.

There are still many places needed to be fixed, 

  the 'ps' commamd only displays process name and rest info is unmeaningful.
  
  the 'mmtest' command will output redundant characters after the first 'vPortFree()' is called.
  
  After running an uncertain period of time, 'mmtest' has chance not to function properly.

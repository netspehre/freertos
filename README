porting my shell from lab19 to freeRTOS based on zzz0072's modification.

Thank and respect zzz0072's effort.

There are still many places needed to be fixed: 

  1.The 'ps' commamd only displays process name and rest info is unmeaningful.
  
  2.I have tested lfsr example code from wiki and my assemblly prng(), they both have the same output sequence.
    However, mmtest() still will appear the 'DBGPRINTF2("OUCH: u=%02X, v=%02X\n", u, v)' massage.
